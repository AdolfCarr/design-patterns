# State

The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. 
This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines. 
The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern, which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.
