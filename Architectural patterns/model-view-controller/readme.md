## Model View Controller âš¡
The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern divides an application into three components.

- Model
- View
- Controllers

### Model
The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or any other business logic related data.

### View
The View component is used for all the UI logic i.e frontend of the application.

### Controllers
Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output.
